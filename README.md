## INTRODUCTION.
**AJNA PROTOCOL OVERVIEW**
Ajna is a non-custodial borrowing and lending protocol for Ethereum. It has some key innovations that set it apart, itâ€™s oracle-less and governance-less in design while providing a peer to pool model.
This means that Ajna does not rely on any external price feeds in order to determine asset prices and does not utilize governance voting to set rates, loan to values or any parameter at all. 
This innovative design reduces risk by removing external points of potential failure or manipulation.
In addition, Ajna is permissionless, meaning that anyone can create a pool for any ERC-20 or ERC-721 compliant assets.
The protocol is completely decentralized and will run autonomously from Ajna labs or any party. Set in stone, the protocol guarantees no risk from governance errors.
